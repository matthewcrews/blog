Mathematical Planning is the field of mathematics that came from the need to find the optimal plan to achieve a desired outcome.

You have a Mathematical Planning problem when you haveâ€¦

1. A Quantifiable Goal
2. Rules to be obeyed
3. Decisions to make

Common Quantifiable Goals are Maximize Profit, Minimize Waste, or Minimize Risk. Rules come from legal restrictions, workforce limitations, or cash flow. The Decisions are the choices that you need to make. Decisions are often how much to order of Product A or Product B. Other examples of Decisions to make are how many people to assign to a given project or where to build a warehouse.

I focus on growing e-commerce retailers that are past $1M in annual revenue and are starting to suffer from inefficiencies in managing their inventory. I have seen firsthand what happens when a promising company fails to take their inventory and cash flow seriously.

I have deployed models which made the company over $1M in additional profit in the first week. Don't stay a slave to manual planning processes. Let me help you and your team transform how you plan inventory and cash flow with Mathematical Planning.
