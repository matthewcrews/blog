title: 'Eradicate Manual Planning'
---

E-commerce retailers live and die based on how well they plan their inventory and cash flow. I am obsessed with maximizing their profit through optimal planning and scheduling. I have worked at the largest of enterprises (Intel, Quicken Loans) and at e-commerce startups. Every place I worked I was able to dramatically increase revenue and decrease costs by automating and optimizing decision making.

My obsessions with efficiency and optimization began with board games. I played Risk for hours growing up and created my own games centered around gathering resources, building cities, and managing trade. I turned that love into a job as I pursued Chemical Engineering, Industrial Engineer, and ultimately Software Development so I could make the planning tools to help others grow their business.

I am on a mission to eradicate manual planning and scheduling from the world. It's slow, itâ€™s error prone, and untold millions have been lost through poor decision making. I have built optimization tools for the harshest supply chains, and I want you to unlock the profits that already exists in your business.

If you have questions [email me](mailto:matthewcrews@gmail.com) and join my newsletter to never miss a post where I show how to maximize profit and minimize carrying cost.
