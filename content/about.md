title: 'Eradicate Wasteful Planning'
---

My obsession with efficiency and optimization began with board games. I played Risk for hours growing up and created games centered around gathering resources, building cities, and managing trade. I turned that love into a job as I pursued Operations Research and Software Development.

I am on a mission to eradicate wasteful planning. Operations Research and Mathematical Programming have developed tools and algorithms for solving the most challenging planning problems that exist. The problem is that Mathematical Programming techniques are often only taught in Operations Research or Industrial Engineering curriculum, which means developers have no awareness that these are solved problems.

I believe that every developer can be an agent of change and transform their business through Mathematical Programming. My mission is to equip my fellow developers with this knowledge to save their companies from wasteful, inefficient planning.
