I am hosting a workshop on Mathematical Planning with .NET on December 28, 2020 at 9:00 AM PST. We will spend 4 hours introducing the idea of Mathematical Planning. The workshop is either a ride-along where you code the examples with me or you can just sit back and enjoy. By the end you will...

- Know when it is appropriate to apply Mathematical Planning
- Have a starting knowledge of how to breakdown business problems into Mathematical Planning models
- Know best practices for structuring model code for testing and refactoring
- Understand the pros and cons of various delivery mechanisms.

Come and join me on in learning how these incredible tools can transform how we make decisions!
