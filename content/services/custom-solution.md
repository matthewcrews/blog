You are sick and tired manually calculating purchase order quantities and are ready get your time back while maximizing your profit

To start, you and I will spend 1-hour discussing where your inventory management is at and see if we are a good fit for one another. If we agree to move forward, I will then meet with your stakeholders and any technical staff that I would need support from. This meeting takes up to 2 hours for me to get input from your team.

Within 2 days I will deliver a proposal made up of three tiers. They will range in price and my level of involvement.
