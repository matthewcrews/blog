You have a team ready to build and deploy an inventory optimization tool, but you need someone to ensure that the tool doesn't bury the business by making incorrect recommendations.

Inventory optimization tools regularly increase profits by over 10% while reduce carrying costs over 20%. For them to be successful though, you need to ensure that the data is good, and the assumptions are correct. When you bring me on to advise your team, I can ensure that your tool will give you the returns you are looking for and will not cause you to make poor buying decisions that drag down your profits.
