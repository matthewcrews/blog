You want to reduce your carrying costs by 25%, you have developers ready to build the tool, you just don't know what to build.

# How It Works

We start with a one-hour call to dig into your pain points around managing your inventory. If we decide that a Blueprint is the right thing for you, we will spend two weeks putting together a detailed architecture and process flow for an inventory optimization tool for your business.

I will meet with you, your key stakeholders, and developers to understand that state of your systems and what technical challenges you are facing. This requires a commitment of 10 - 15 hours from your team for meetings over the span of 2 weeks. At the end of the two weeks, we will have a 1-hour technical overview where I will take you and your team through the architecture.

At the end you will have a blueprint for a product that you know will be able to increase your profits by 10% and reduce carrying costs up to 25%. You will also have the assurance that it will scale with you as your business grows because these solutions have been used in the largest of enterprises.

Deliverables will be a technical document, process flows, and schematics for an inventory optimization tool that best fits your business needs. You team will be able to reach out to me for follow up questions for 2 weeks after the technical overview for clarification.

**Cost: $5,950**
