You are ready to transform your planning tools with Mathematical Programming but are unsure where to start. Let's take an hour to figure out precisely what kind of problem you have and the best tools for solving it. Sometimes all you need is someone who's seen the problem before to help you get unstuck.

You will come away with a clear picture of what the best approaches are for solving your problem and know the kind of returns you can expect if you use Mathematical Programming to solve your planning problem.
