# What is Programming?


At some point I believe most of us get confronted with the question of, "What is programming?" Now, I'm not talking about Computer Science. The answer to what is Computer Science is relatively straightforward. It is the study of how to arrange computation in the most efficient means possible given a set of constraints on resources. That may not be quite the technical definition but I believe that captures the essence.
