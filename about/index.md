# About Matthew Crews


Performance, Simulation, and  Optimization. Three of my favorite words ðŸ˜Š.

I've been obsessed with building decision optimization tools for business since college. I studied Chemical and Industrial Engineering so that I can build tools to maximize profitability and efficiency.

To optimize a business, you need a simulation or model of how it operates. For a simulation to be useful, it must be fast. To be fast, you need high-performance code.

By bringing these three passions together I have helped companies make millions in additional profit and massively reduce waste and inefficiency.

In this blog I share my experience of using F# to write high-performance simulations to optimize profit and efficiency.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions. I'd love to help!
